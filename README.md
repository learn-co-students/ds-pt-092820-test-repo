# Online DS PT 092820 - GIF-Stravaganza

This week's challenge is to contribute to a Git repository, using branches and pull requests! We'll be using a Git branching workflow to all contribute to this README file.

## Steps

1. Accept the invite to collaborate on this repository (should be an email sent to the email address associated with your GitHub account)
2. Clone down this repository (**don't fork it!**) to a good place on your computer
3. Create a new branch on your local repository (I recommend naming your branch after yourself, so my branch is named *Lindsey*)
4. Find a GIF or image that summarizes how you're feeling this week
5. Use Markdown syntax to add the GIF or image to this README.md file **under your name**
6. Add and commit your local changes to your branch
7. Push **your branch** to this repository (this step will not work if you forgot to checkout a branch in step 2!)
8. Start a pull request for me to review

I will either accept your pull request, or send you feedback on what you need to do to improve!

## Note!

We did not discuss branches/pull requests much when we introduced Git last week. Plus, maybe you've never used Markdown syntax to add an image to a Markdown file before (or never edited a README or other Markdown file before). **Part of this challenge is to Google your way through steps you haven't done before!** Use resources you find, plus Git/GitHub's documentation, to add your GIF or image on here successfully!

Look at the branches and pending pull requests on this repo to see an example in progress!
